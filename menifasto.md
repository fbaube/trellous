# The Name

Trees are *everywhere* in I.T. and in Knowledge Representation. There's no avoiding them. And when your hammer is an RDMS, trees are difficult to nail.

But RelFS (and its author) have some interesting ideas. And there is also the idea of muiltitrees to help organise complex trees. So, we have

So let's say: `Tree + RelFS + Multitree ~= Trellis`

... _(and a trellis is what a multitree can look like)_

# IRL

Trees form the basis of filesystems, because nothing better
has gained world domination quite like ismple trees have.
(Hard linke and soft links are just window dressing.)

Tags might seem like part of a cure. Perhaps you're thinking of
a vast flattened pool of content, with faceted tag search for
narrowing searches down. But this doesn't really work either.
Not well, anyways.

Tags themselves need to be hierarchical, so that's a complicating factor.

And when you're talking content reuse (for example), it's not just
child nodes that are important, it's multiple parent nodes too.
There's **Contents** and then there's **Contexts**.
